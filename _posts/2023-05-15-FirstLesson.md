# Lesson 1 From the Course
## Learning Activities
**The First Learning activity was the *is it a bird* tutorial**. <br />
This introduced the ideas of how to get images from the internet, how to create the model and a little bit about the data loaders and the data block. <br />
Then it went into the learn.predict function and how to use that to predict images that you give it and the outputs <br />
**The Next Learning activity was the how to use Juptyer Notebooks on Kaggle** <br />
Is showed how to set up the fastai environmnet in kaggle and how to get the GPUs <br />
Here is [A link](https://www.kaggle.com) to Kaggle <br />
**The Next Learning activity the pretrained models** <br />
This went into the use of fine_tune and the vision_learner and a couple different architectures <br />
## Key Takeaways 
- How to get images into the model using search_images_ddg <br />
- How to use dataloaders and create the learn model and fine tune it <br />
- How to test the model using predict <br />
- How to create the Jupyter Notebook <br />

## How this is Applicable 
We will have to use the internet to get pictures for Question 2 in the assignment. <br />
I created my own Kaggle page and Jupyter Notebook for Question 3 which you can find in The Assignment Blog Post<br />
