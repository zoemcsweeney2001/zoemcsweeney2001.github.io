# Lesson 3 From the Course
## Learning Activities
**The First Learning activity was Creating a Pet Breed Detector and then improving on it**. <br />
This introduced how you would save your model again and using paperspace and JupyterLabs to do so. <br />

**The Next Learning activity was on how to decide on the image model**
A link to the Kaggle Notebook that it was worked from is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/which-image-models-are-best) <br />
And hten there is another one that is about vision leanring which is a bit more practicle for starting and is linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/the-best-vision-models-for-fine-tuning)  <br />
T
It used the bears example to show you how to use the ImageClassifierCleaner to remove invalid images from the datatset<br />
It then went into a little bit more about the data blocks and using the data augmenter to increase the speed of the leaner <br />
It also showed how to create a confusion matrix which is pictured below <br />

**The Next Learning activity On Getting the model ready for the use on Hugging Face space**

This introduced how you would take your model and create an app for it in [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces) <br />
This is all documented but it showed different methods to get it from kaggle or download it and then create a python script which can be uploaded <br />

## Key Takeaways 
- How to download a pretrained model <br />
- How to get data about the Classification and plotting it <br />
- How to create an app with you model br />

## How this is Applicable 
It is good to visualise data and is necessary for the assignment <br />
The app is not as necessary but still an interesting concept for further projects<br />
