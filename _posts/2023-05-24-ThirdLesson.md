![Heart](/images/heart.png) <br />
## Learning Activities
**The First Learning activity was Creating a Pet Breed Detector and then improving on it**.
<br />
This introduced how you would save your model again and using paperspace and JupyterLabs to do so. <br />

**The Next Learning activity was on how to decide on the image model**
A link to the Kaggle Notebook that it was worked from is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/which-image-models-are-best) <br />
And hten there is another one that is about vision leanring which is a bit more practicle for starting and is linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/the-best-vision-models-for-fine-tuning)  <br />
There is a handy image that shows the differnet models against time and accuracy, the top left is the best option with high accuracy and not long run time <br />

**The Next Learning activity was about loss functions and how neural nets work**

It just gave an example using polynomials about how it makes the model fit and all the parameters involved <br />

## Key Takeaways 
- Using a model that exists is easier than making a whole new net <br />
- How to compare different nets <br />
- Understanding on how they work

## How this is Applicable 
Question 3 is about trying to make the model fastest and most accurate therefore a good achitecture is a good starting point
